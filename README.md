### About the game:
'Descent into Discord' was created for a personal "game jam" by myself (Mathieu Dombrock) in the summer of 2017. My goal was to create a fun text based RPG for my friends and I during the break between my summer and fall quarters. Originally the scope of this game was VERY small and about 80% of the features that the game has now were not originally planned. This is the main reason that the code is so gross and the lists are nonsensical. Originally, the game was not even planned to be open-source let alone public. 
 
### Known Issues:
The game might be fun but reading the code is not. The code is very fragile.
 
A lot of the text is not written in the correct person and refers to the player when it should refer to the players avatar.
